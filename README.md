# Cuber - Currently A Java Swing Implementation of a Rubix Cube

The current Repository holds my work on a little side-project I've been working on with Java Swing over the past few months. There isn't anything too fancy with this right now other than a few algorithms for rotating an NxN matrix and code for face rotations, but in the future, cube solving algorithms should be implemented, as well as a 3D mode for the cube since 2D mode is a bit confusing unless you know what to look for.
